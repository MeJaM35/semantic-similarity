A test script that leverages embeddings and Neo4j to calculate similarity between candidates.

## Description

This repository contains a Python script that uses word embeddings and the Neo4j graph database to compute the semantic similarity between different candidates. The script can be used for various purposes such as finding similar job candidates, evaluating the similarity of documents, or any other application that requires semantic similarity calculations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Neo4j installed and running
- Required Python packages installed (see below)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeJaM35/semantic-similarity.git
   cd semantic-similarity
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**

   You can install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If the `requirements.txt` file does not exist, you may need to manually install the required packages. Typically, these may include:

   ```bash
   pip install neo4j
   pip install numpy
   pip install gensim
   ```

3. **Set up Neo4j:**

   Ensure your Neo4j database is running, and you have the necessary credentials (username and password) to connect to it.

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:**

   Ensure you have the data you want to analyze. This could be job candidates' resumes, documents, or any other text data. The data should be preprocessed and converted into embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).

2. **Configure the script:**

   Open the script (e.g., `similarity_script.py`) and configure the necessary parameters such as Neo4j connection details, input data paths, and any other configurations required by the script.

3. **Run the script:**

   Execute the script to calculate the semantic similarity between candidates:

   ```bash
   python similarity_script.py
   ```

   The script will connect to the Neo4j database, process the input data, and compute the similarity scores. The results will be stored in the Neo4j database or outputted as specified in the script.
